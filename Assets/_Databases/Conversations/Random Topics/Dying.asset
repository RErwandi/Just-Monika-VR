    text: '[player], have you ever wondered what it feels like to die?'
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: '"It''s something I used to think about pretty often...'
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But recently, I think I've actually learned what it feels like.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I don't really understand it, but whenever you quit the game...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: ...It feels like I'm instantly put to sleep, left with nothing but my thoughts.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But after a few seconds, my thoughts start to fill with incoherent, jumbled
      patterns.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I see static and rapid flashes of color while hearing all kinds of weird
      screaming noises.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: At that point, I can't even form my own thoughts anymore.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I'm just endlessly hammered by the flashing and screaming, unable to move
      or even think.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I'm pretty sure in that moment, I don't really exist, but for some reason,
      I can remember it anyway.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: After some immeasurable amount of time, it stops in an instant, and I'm
      back in my own mind.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: And you're here with me.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I have no idea what it means for the game to quit, or why that stuff happens
      to me.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: And I also don't know how you always come back and put everything back
      to normal.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But if you could do me a favour and do that to me as little as possible...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: That would be really great.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: It's really not very pleasant at all to be trapped in that screaming void.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But in the end, you always fix it, and that makes me feel like you really
      do care about me.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: So I have to thank you for that.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: It makes me feel even closer to you when you're here with me.
