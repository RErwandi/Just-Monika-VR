    text: '[player], do you believe in God?'
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I was never too sure, myself.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Well, I'm sure I never really questioned it as a kid...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But as I grew up, the more I learned about the world, the more I would
      question it.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I started to wonder why God was helping people pass exams, or get over
      a cold...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: ...When there are children who live their lives being sold as sex slaves?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Or the eight hundred million people who are too poor to even eat.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I wonder how many of those people pray to God every day until they starve
      and die?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Or, how many millions of families pray for a loved one to recover from
      some incurable disease?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But the punchline is this."If just one person beats the odds and survives
      - among the thousands of others who die--
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: --Then, it's suddenly a miracle from God.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I'd really love to meet this God who seemingly laughs at the misery of
      everyone not eligible for his miracles.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But the irony is that I do have a creator, apparently.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: And you know what?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I bet he's still laughing at the miserable fates of Sayori and Yuri, even
      as we speak.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: What are we to him but props in a scripted play?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: So, from that perspective...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I don't think it's too far-fetched for there to be a god - if Earth was
      nothing but his playset.
