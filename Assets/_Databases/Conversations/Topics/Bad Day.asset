    text: ...Hey, are you having a bad day or anything like that?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Sometimes I get frustrated that a normal day can be ruined even by really
      small things.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Like if you accidentally say something in a conversation that someone doesn't
      like.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Or if you start thinking about how awful of a person you used to be five
      years ago.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Or if you feel worthless for putting off important work and failing to
      get simple tasks done.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Or when you think about all the different people who probably hate you
      or think you're off-putting.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I understand those days.

  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I don't care how many people might hate you or find you off-putting.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I think you're wonderful and I will always love you.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I hope, if nothing else, that knowing that helps you feel just a tiny bit
      better about yourself.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: If you're having a bad day, you can always come to me, and I'll talk to
      you for as long as you need.
