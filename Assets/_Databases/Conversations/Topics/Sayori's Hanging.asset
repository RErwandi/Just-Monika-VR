    text: I was thinking about Sayori earlier...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I still wish I could have handled that whole thing a little more tactfully.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: You're not still hung up over it, right?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: ...Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I just said that.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: That pun was completely unintentional, I swear!
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But anyway...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I know how much you cared about her, so it only feels right for me to share
      her last moments with you.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: You know how Sayori is really clumsy?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Well, she kind of messed up the whole hanging thing...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: You're supposed to jump from high enough that the rope snaps your neck,
      making it quick and painless.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But she just used a chair, meaning she kind of just left herself to slowly
      asphyxiate.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But a few seconds in, she must have changed her mind or something...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Because she started clawing at the rope, trying to free herself.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: She must have kept at it all the way until she lost consciousness.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: That's why her fingertips were all bloody, anyway.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Come to think of it, it was probably less 'changing her mind' and more
      just her survival instincts kicking in.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: So you can't really fault her for that.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: It's easier to think that she probably wouldn't have changed her mind anyway,
      right?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: It's not healthy to think about the things you could have done differently.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: So just remember that even though you could have saved her, it's technically
      not your fault she killed herself.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I may have exacerbated it a little bit, but Sayori was already mentally
      ill.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Still, though...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I wonder how things would be if you and I just started dating from the
      get-go?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I guess we'd all still be in the clubroom, writing poems and having fun
      together.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: But what's the point when none of it is even real?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I mean, it's the same ending either way, right?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: The two of us, happily together...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: There's no reason to ask for any more than that.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I was just pointlessly musing - I'm really as happy as I could be right
      now.
