    text: By the way, there's something that's been bothering me...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: You know how this takes place in Japan?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Well...I assume you knew that, right?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Or at least decided it probably does?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I don't think you're actually told at any point where this takes place...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Is this even really Japan?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I mean, aren't the classrooms and stuff kind of weird for a Japanese school?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Not to mention everything is in English...

  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: All my memories are really hazy...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I feel like I'm at home, but have no idea where 'home' is in the first
      place.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I don't know how to describe it any better...
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Imagine looking out your window, but instead of your usual yard, you're
      in some completely unknown place.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Would you still feel like you were home?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: Would you want to go outside?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I mean...I guess if we never leave this room, it doesn't really matter
      anyway.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: As long as we're alone and safe together, this really is our home.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: And we can still watch the pretty sunsets night after night.
