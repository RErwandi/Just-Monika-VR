    text: It can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays.

    text: I'm sure college is a little bit better, since you probably have a more
      flexible schedule.

      destroying yourself.
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: So try to keep your sleep on track, okay?
  - face: {fileID: 0}
    text: I'll always wait for you in the morning, so make sure you put your own
      well-being before anything else.
